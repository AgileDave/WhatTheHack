## Hackflow

1. For creating a new User Flow for Profile Edit, the process will be very similar to the SUSI flow creation. Identify the attributes that will be updated and then test the new flow.
2. For modifying the display of attributes, this can all be done by selecting the User Flow to modify and then selecting **Page Layouts**.

    - You'll want to modify the **Local Account Sign Up Page** for modifying attributes on the SignUp flow.
    - You'll also want to do the same for the **Social Account Sign Up Page**
    - Repeat this if you modify the Profile Edit flow

3. Adding an additional language can be accomplished by selecting the User Flow and then selecting **Languages**

    - You'll want to **Enable Language Customization** from the menu
