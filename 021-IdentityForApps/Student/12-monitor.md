# What The Hack - Challenge Template

# Challenge \#12 - BONUS: Hey, What's Going On In My B2C Tenant??

[< Previous Challenge](./11-parameterize.md) - **[Home](../readme.md)**

## Pre-requisites (Optional)

- Provisioned a B2C tenant
- Deployed User Flows and/or Custom Policies
- Added External IdPs, Included Conditional Access, Called to REST APIs

## Description

We've done a lot with Azure AD B2C and CMC Leadership is really thrilled with everything. They have one last ask -- is there a way we can monitor our B2C activity around logins, conditional access request, failed logins, etc.

They are already Log Analytics users, so if there's a way to incorporate B2C monitoring into Log Analytics, that would be fantastic.

Also, CMC would like to see some workbooks providing different views of the B2C activity - can we visualize certain events in our B2C tenant?

## Success Criteria

To successfully complete this challenge, enable Azure Monitor for your B2C tenant. Take a look at the Learning Resources section in order for some ideas on how to incorporate your B2C logs into a Log Analytics workspace.

At the end of this challenge, you should be able to:

- Export B2C logs into a Log Analytics workspace;
- Create some queries and/or visualizations for events such as failed logins, coniditional access requests.
- BONUS: Using the Learning Resources below, create a Workbook to collect different events. This is not required for successfully completing this challenge.
